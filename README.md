# FfmPeg-Transcoding
Transcoding - It is a process of converting an audio or video file from one encoding format to another in order to increase the number of compatible target device a media file can be played on . In other words it is the process of exporting digital video into a particular format.

Basically, When the video is streaming over enough bandwidth networks, the delivered video quality is good. But when the link is congested and bandwidth is not enough to transmit all the video packets, the delivered video quality is worse. So in this case, we can use transcoding to let the bandwidth requirement for video streaming become less. Then the delivered video quality may not be good, but can still be acceptable.
